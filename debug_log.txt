After a long day, I figured that some time in the library would do well for
me. I could use somewhere quiet to wind down.

Keisuke
(Geez, I expected quiet, but this room is practically abandoned!)

Even though a few hours had passed, what Tashi-sensei said was still ringing
in my head. I wasn't completely sure how to process what had been going on,
but I was worried to say the least.

Keisuke
(I need to sit down...the table over there looks good.)

I grabbed a chair, sat down at the table and, resting my head on my hands, I
let out a long sigh.

Keisuke
Well, I never got anywhere by just moping... right?

Shiori
*Ahem*

Keisuke
Eh?

I looked over to the table adjacent, where I saw Shiori-san flipping through
the pages of a large book.

Keisuke
A-ah! Shiori-san, how are y-

Shiori
Hotsure-san, adjust your volume in the library, please.

Keisuke
(Oh...right.)

Keisuke
Sorry, Shiori-san.
